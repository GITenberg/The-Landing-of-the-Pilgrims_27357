<h3><i>HOW TO BE A GOOD RADIO ACTOR</i></h3>


<p>The play in this book has actually been produced on the radio. Possibly
you have listened to this one when you tuned in at home. The
persons whose voices you heard as you listened, looked just as they did
when they left their homes to go to the studio, although they were
taking the parts of men and women who lived long ago and who wore
costumes very different from the ones we wear today.</p>

<p>The persons whose voices you heard stood close together around the
microphone, each one reading from a copy of the play in his hand.
Since they could not be seen, they did not act parts as in other plays,
but tried to make their voices show how they felt.</p>

<p>When you give these plays you will not need costumes and you will
not need scenery, although you can easily arrange a broadcasting studio
if you wish. You will not need to memorize your parts; in fact, it
will not be like a real radio broadcast if you do so, and, furthermore,
you will not want to, since you will each have a copy of the book in
your hands. All you will need to do is to remember that you are taking
the part of a radio actor, that you are to read your speeches very distinctly,
and that by your voice you will make your audience understand
how you feel. In this way you will have the fun of living
through some of the great moments of history.</p>


<h3><i>HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS IN THE PLAY</i></h3>

<p>There are some directions in this play which may be new to you, but
these are necessary, for you are now in a radio broadcasting studio,
talking in front of a microphone. The word [<i>in</i>] means that the
character is standing close to the microphone, while [<i>off</i>] indicates that
he is farther away, so that his voice sounds faint. When the directions
[<i>off</i>, <i>coming in</i>] are given, the person speaking is away from the microphone
at first but gradually comes closer. The words [<i>mob</i>] or [<i>crowd
noise</i>] you will understand mean the sound of many people talking in
the distance.</p>

<p>Both the English and the dialect used help make the characters live,
so the speeches have been written in the way in which these men and
women would talk. This means that sometimes the character may use
what seems to you unusual English. The punctuation helps, too, to
make the speeches sound like real conversation; for example, you will
find that a dash is often used to show that a character is talking very
excitedly.</p>

<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>It was in the month of December in 1620 that the Pilgrim
Fathers landed on Plymouth Rock and proceeded to establish
the first permanent white settlement in New England.
But the Pilgrims had not set out for America to establish
their new home in New England&mdash;far from it&mdash;they
had a charter permitting their settlement in the northern
portion of the Virginia plantation, and it was toward Virginia
that the little band of passengers aboard the Mayflower
thought they were heading. The story of how they
happened to come to the stern and rockbound coast of
New England and of how they happened to stay there and
carve out of the wilderness a great commonwealth is told
here.</p>

<p>Let us begin our story in Leyden, Holland, where for some
eleven years the Pilgrims have lived in exile from England,
driven out because of their religious faith. It is early in
the year 1620, and John Robinson, who is the pastor and
leader of the Pilgrims, is talking to John Carver, who is
one of the elders of the church.<!-- Page 2 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>No word yet from Elder Brewster?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Nay, not a word. I fear me that he and Master Cushman
have found it impossible to raise such a large sum of
money.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>If we delay much longer King James may repent himself
of his generosity in allowing us to settle in Virginia.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>I begin to fear that we are doomed to spend the rest of
our days in Holland.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Nay, nay, do not lose heart. Jehovah will find a way for
his children. Remember, the Children of Israel wandered
for forty years in the wilderness before they found rest in
the Promised Land.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>I'll not lose faith, Pastor Robinson. I know a way will be
found for us. [<i>knock</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Will you see who's at the door?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Of course, Pastor. [<i>sound of opening door</i>] Good day to
you, sir.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Does Master John Robinson dwell here?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Aye. Will you enter?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Thank you.<!-- Page 3 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Pastor Robinson, this gentleman would speak with you.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Good morrow to you, sir.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Are you Pastor Robinson, then?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>I am. And to what do I owe the honor of this visit, Master&mdash;ah&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>My name is Kieft, Wilhelm Kieft, at your service.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>I am honored, Master Kieft. Allow me to present Master
Carver. [<i>they greet each other</i>]</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>And now to the business that brought me here&mdash;it is
rumored about Leyden that you and your company are
about to leave Leyden. Is that true?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>There is, as yet, nothing certain, Master Kieft.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>But you are planning an emigration to the New World,
are you not?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>It has been talked of, certainly, but thus far we have not
found the means.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Well, Master Robinson, perhaps I can find them for you.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Indeed!<!-- Page 4 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Tell us, Master Kieft!</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>I am a member of the Dutch West India Company, which
possesses a large tract of land in the New World.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Indeed, I did not know that.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Ah, yes, through the discovery of a countryman of yours,
Henry Hudson, who sailed under our flag, we own the
country from the Great South River to the Great North
River, where, I am told, the climate is healthful and pleasant,
and the land rich and bountiful.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>And what do you propose to us?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>My company is prepared to furnish you land upon which
to found a colony, and capital to carry you and your
people there and support you until you have made yourselves
self-supporting.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>And for this you would expect of us&mdash;what?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Some small share of your profits.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Yes, and what else?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Nothing, except that you should live under the Dutch flag
and make our claim to the land secure.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Your offer is generous, Master Kieft.<!-- Page 5 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>And you make no other conditions than those you mention?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>None, I assure you.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Can you offer them in writing so that our people may consider
them?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Indeed, yes, if you are interested, my company will make
you a written offer within a fortnight.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>We are interested, Master Kieft, very much so.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Good. You shall receive our conditions as soon as I can
arrange it. Good day!</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Good day, sir, and thank you.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Jehovah has heard our prayer. The way is open. Mayhap&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Is it not a generous offer?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Generous? Aye, but still&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>I like it not.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Indeed, and why not?<!-- Page 6 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Why should the Dutch West India Company make us such
a generous offer?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Why indeed, but that we may establish for them a colony
in the New World?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Aye, a colony that will give them a stronger hold upon
disputed land.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Do you think the land is disputed?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>I know but little of the New World. I know not even
where the Great North River or the Great South River
may be, but only this I know: King James and his Virginia
Company would take it much amiss, that having a
patent to lands in Virginia, we turned to the Dutch and
settled under their flag.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>And what has King James ever done for us but persecute
us, drive us from our homes, and make of us pilgrims upon
the face of the earth?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Aye, but I am an Englishman. I had looked with joy upon
our emigration to America, because I had hoped we could
once again live under British rule.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Many of our company have felt the same; but if we cannot
go except under the Dutch flag, still we must go.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Aye.<!-- Page 7 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>The hand of Jehovah leads us; we must follow.</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So the offer of the Dutch West India Company was received
and in due course of time the provisions were put
into writing. The Pilgrim company discussed the offer
from every angle. All of them would have preferred to
settle under the British flag, if it could have been arranged,
but because more than six months had passed and they had
not found anyone who could finance them, they felt that
the Dutch offer should be accepted.</p>

<p>Therefore, near the end of February, 1620, Pastor Robinson
and Elder Carver meet with Wilhelm Kieft to settle
finally the matter of the emigration. Let us listen as they
talk together.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Two ships and one thousand pounds, which you can repay
in ten years.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>And all your company demands is a monopoly in the fur
trade?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>That is all. Otherwise you shall do what pleases you; but
all of the fur must belong to the Dutch West India
Company.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>That seems just. What think you, Elder Carver?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Who shall govern us, Master Kieft?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>You shall say that yourself. Who governs you now?<!-- Page 8 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>We have no governor except the Elders of the Church.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>It shall be the same in the New World.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Do the terms satisfy you, Pastor Robinson?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Indeed, I am more than satisfied.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Then shall we sign the articles? [<i>rattle of paper</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>I can think of nothing more we should consider, can you,
Elder?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Then, if you have a quill, we can sign now. [<i>knock</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Your pardon, someone knocks.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER [<i>going</i>]</p>

<p>I'll see who it is.</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Thank you, Elder. Ah, here is the quill. Now, where is
the inkhorn? Ah, yes, here.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Sign here. [<i>rattle of paper</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Let us wait for Elder Carver.<!-- Page 9 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Oh, Pastor Robinson?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Your pardon, sir, will you come here at once?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Thomas Weston of London desires to see you.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Can we not finish our business first?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Tell him to come in and sit down while we get this business
finished.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Will you come in, Master Weston?</p>

<p class="center">WESTON [<i>coming in</i>]</p>

<p>Thank you. Have I the honor of addressing Master Robinson?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>I'm Robinson.</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>I'm Thomas Weston, and I have come on behalf of a company
of London merchants&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT [<i>sharply</i>]</p>

<p>Master Robinson, your pardon, but may we not finish this
business in hand?<!-- Page 10 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Certainly! Elder Carver, Master Kieft is waiting for us
to sign the Articles of Emigration.</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>Your pardon, Master Robinson, did you say "Articles of
Emigration"?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Why, yes.</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>I have an offer to make you for the emigration of your
company.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>I must insist, sir&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>One moment, Master Kieft.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Are you going to sign or not?</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Master Kieft, this may cause us to change our plans; we
must consider. What is your offer, Master Weston?</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>A company of seven London merchants has agreed to furnish
ships and capital to carry you and your people to
America.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>You have already agreed with me<!-- Page 11 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>We have signed nothing yet. Where, Master Weston, does
your company propose that we settle?</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>In northern Virginia&mdash;between the Great South River
and the Great North River.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>That, sir, is the land of the Dutch West India Company.</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>Your pardon, but King James has decreed&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT [<i>getting angrier</i>]</p>

<p>I care not what your sovereign may have decreed&mdash;he
has no claim to that land. My company discovered and
explored it!</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>Has your company established any plantations there?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>That makes no difference.</p>

<p class="center">WESTON</p>

<p>Until you have established plantations, you cannot claim
it.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>I do not wish to argue with you, sir. I am here to close
this business with you, Master Robinson. I am waiting&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>We must have time to consider&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>I had your word.<!-- Page 12 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Master Kieft, the situation has changed. We are Englishmen,
and if we can emigrate under our own flag, you cannot
blame us for preferring it to another.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>You have tricked us&mdash;you are not treating me fairly!</p>

<p class="center">ROBINSON</p>

<p>Now, sir&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT [<i>louder</i>]</p>

<p>And I warn you if you go to our land under the British
flag, you shall regret it, sir, you shall regret it. Good day!

<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>Thus the Pilgrims incurred the enmity of the Dutch West
India Company, and though the terms of the London merchants
were not so generous as those offered by the Dutch
company, the Pilgrims accepted them and set about making
their preparations for the great adventure.</p>

<p>They secured for their voyage two ships, the <i>Speedwell</i>
and the <i>Mayflower</i>.</p>

<p>Our next scene is early in July of 1620. The <i>Mayflower</i>
has been engaged for the voyage, and is lying at anchor
in the Thames River off London, where it is undergoing
some repairs preparatory to taking on cargo, which is to
come to the New World. Aboard the ship is only the
master, Captain Jones, when he is disturbed by&mdash;</p>

<p>Ahoy! Who's hailing the <i>Mayflower</i>?<!-- Page 13 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>What do you want?</p>

<p>I'm master. What do you want?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>May I come aboard?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Come aboard. The ladder's over the side.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>All right, I'm coming. [<i>lower</i>] Keep the boat alongside!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Aye, aye, sir!</p>

<p>Aye, aye, sir!</p>

<p>Here you are&mdash;right up here, sir. Give me your hand!
Ah, there you are, sir!</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT [<i>in</i>]</p>

<p>Thank you, sir. Are you the master of the ship?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I am, sir.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>I understand you are engaged for the voyage.<!-- Page 14 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>That we are, sir, to America.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Aye, yes&mdash;by a company of London merchants.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>And what's that to you, sir, begging your pardon?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>No matter, I know well enough you are. And now, sir,
I want to know if you'd like to put yourself in the way of
earning a hundred pounds?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>A hundred! Law, sir, and who wouldn't?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Exactly! I hoped I'd find you a man of sense.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>What do you want me to do?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>You are sailing for northern Virginia, are you not?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>That's the orders.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Where do you expect to make land?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I was looking to make it in the mouth of the Great North
River.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Hm&mdash;you know, I suppose, that the Dutch West India
Company claims all the land bordering on the Great North
River.<!-- Page 15 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES [<i>laughing</i>]</p>

<p>Why, sir, everybody claims it. That's no matter. King
James has proclaimed that all the land that has been settled
belongs to them that has settled it; the rest is anybody's.
When the company I'm taking gets their plantation settled,
the Dutch can't claim the land any longer.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Perhaps not, but your company is not going to land on
Dutch territory.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>You are going to lose your bearings&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Me&mdash;a sailor&mdash;lose my bearings?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Certainly&mdash;for one hundred pounds.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Well&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>And you will make land far to the north of the Great
North River.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I'll have to see the color of the money.</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>Is it a bargain?</p>

<p class="center">KIEFT</p>

<p>I have, and on your promise, I'll pay it.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

wish.</p>

<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>And so Captain Jones of the <i>Mayflower</i> was bribed by
Dutch gold to play false with the band of Pilgrims. You
know the story of the long and difficult job the Pilgrims
had in getting fairly started on their voyage. The <i>Speedwell</i>
sprang a leak, and they had to put back to Plymouth
harbor where the ship was repaired. They made a second
start, and again the <i>Speedwell</i> became unseaworthy and
the captain refused to go on, so a second time the little
flotilla put back to Plymouth. This time, since the season
was far advanced and the Pilgrims feared that winter
would be upon them before they could get established in
their new home, the <i>Speedwell</i> was left behind, and on
September 16, 1620, the <i>Mayflower</i> left alone for the New
World. Halfway across the ocean the ship was beset by a
long series of storms, so severe that it took more than two
months for the ship to make the trip across the Atlantic.
At last, on the morning of November 20, 1620, the ship's
company were awakened by the electric cry of&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Land&mdash;ho! Land&mdash;land&mdash;ho!</p>

Have we really made land?

<p>Aye, we've made land! Helmsman, bring the ship to bear

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Aye, aye, sir, land dead ahead.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER [<i>coming up</i>]</p>

<p>Do you not know where we are?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>How should I? We've been tossed about in storms for a
month, with no sun for days on end.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>There is sun this morning. Can you not take your bearings
now?<!-- Page 18 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>The mate is figuring our position even now.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Good!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Captain Jones?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, mate, have you the position?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>I made it, sir, about seventy west by forty-two north.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Forty-two north&mdash;but, Captain, we are bound for forty
north&mdash;we're out of our course.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>What do you expect&mdash;with the storms we've had?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Put your ship about&mdash;make for the south&mdash;this is not
Virginia!</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>We'll land here.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>We have no right to land here. Our charter grants us land
in Virginia, not here!</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I can't help that. The ship is in bad shape&mdash;I won't risk
sailing her any farther without repairs.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Very well, you may stop here for repairs, but we must go
on as soon as they are made.<!-- Page 19 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>It will take some time.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>My people will help you. We must speed the work.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Of course, I'll speed it all I can, but a man can't do any
more than he can do.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Well, get to it at once&mdash;this very day! We must get
away from here within a fortnight or winter will be upon
us.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, so it will&mdash;and the winters in this country are bad.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Then we must start south without delay.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Look you, Master Carver&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Well, Captain?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Belikes 'twill be a month or more before I can make the
<i>Mayflower</i> seaworthy&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>A month? Surely you can do better than that?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Perhaps not so well&mdash;why don't you land here?</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Here?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye. 'Tis a goodly country&mdash;full as rich as Virginia.<!-- Page 20 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Nay, nay, 'tis not to be thought on. We have a patent to
lands in Virginia&mdash;a charter to establish and rule a plantation
there; but here&mdash;why, the land is not ours&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>It is if you take it&mdash;it belongs to no one else.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>But our Council would have no rights under the King&mdash;nay,
nay. We go on to Virginia&mdash;as soon as you have
made your repairs.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>So be it, Master Carver.</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So the <i>Mayflower</i> brought up to anchor just inside Cape
Cod, near the present village of Provincetown. The
voyage had been long and arduous. There had been much
sickness aboard, and Captain Jones knew that most of the
passengers longed to set foot on solid ground and begin the
task of building their homes. So he determined to create
further dissatisfaction among them.</p>

<p>For our next scene we are going into Captain Jones's cabin
just as one of the five men of the company, Peter Brown,
has come into the cabin on the captain's invitation.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Sit you down, Master Brown, and find what comfort you
can in my poor quarters.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Poor! If this cabin is poor, Captain, what do ye call what
us folks has to put up with, all crowded into the common
cabin like sheep er worse?<!-- Page 21 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, 'tis too bad the cabin is not a better place for your
goodly company.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Aye, well, we'll soon be out of it.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I fear me, not so soon.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Indeed, why?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>The ship must be repaired before we can go on.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>How long will that take ye?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Mayhap two months or more, I know not.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Two months? Two months more in the cabin of this ship
and half of our company will be dead.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, belikes they will&mdash;and winter will be upon us hard
and heavy. The winters in this country are worse than
any you have ever seen in England or Holland.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>The snow lies so deep it would cover a man's head&mdash;the
land is blotted out, and even the sea freezes&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Then how could we get ashore?<!-- Page 22 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I know not.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>And once ashore, how could we find a fair place to build
our homes?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>'Tis not for me to say.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Why can't we land right here, Captain?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Because your Elder, Master Carver, says fix the ship and
go on.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>If Elder Carver says that, then there be naught that we
kin do.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>You'd stay packed in the ship's cabin, facing sickness and
death, rather than rise up like men and tell the Elder what
you will and what you won't do, eh?</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Elder Carver and the twelve masters have the voice; we
have naught to do but to obey.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Can it be that forty English freemen can't vote down
twelve masters?</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Under our charter the freemen have no voice.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Under the charter, eh?</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Aye, so there's naught to do but what the masters say.<!-- Page 23 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Have you never heard of mutiny?</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Mutiny? Nay, we be lawful men, bound together in the
love of Jehovah; we'll not mutiny! We must abide by our
charter.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>The charter, aye.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>So there's naught to do&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Hold&mdash;have you thought on this&mdash;the charter binds you
under the King's grant in Virginia Plantation&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Aye.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>And you are not in Virginia&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Nay, not yet.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>So you are not bound by the Virginia charter in these
waters.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Forsooth, Captain, I'd not thought on that.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>You have here all the rights of free-born Englishmen. And
if you rise like men and demand that your Elders hearken
to your voice, who shall gainsay you?</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Aye&mdash;who&mdash;who, indeed? If we vote to land here, 'tis
not mutiny.<!-- Page 24 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Nay, 'tis but your right, if you want to land here.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>We do&mdash;we do! Not a man in the company but would
stay here if he had his way.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Then have your way&mdash;like Englishmen! Go to your
cabin. Talk to the men of your company, tell them what
I have told you.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Aye, Captain, I will! At once. [<i>going</i>]</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Good! [<i>sound of door closing</i>] [<i>to himself</i>] Well, Elder
Carver, we shall see whose voice is stronger&mdash;yours, or the
voice of forty English freemen!</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>Thus Captain Jones planted in the mind of one of the
freemen of the Pilgrim company an idea which he was
sure would bear fruit before many hours. He watched
the company as first one man and then another fell in with
Peter Brown. He felt the temper of the company changing,
but he still did not feel that mutiny was likely against
the strong religious authority of the Elders. And so to
bring the matter to a head, he asked Carver to come to his
cabin. As the door closes, the captain begins&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>I fear me, Master Carver, we are in a bad way.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Indeed&mdash;why?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>The carpenter has gone over the ship timber by timber<!-- Page 25 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>It is a long, hard job we have before us.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Oh, too bad, too bad! How long?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>What with finding the proper timbers ashore, and hewing
them to fit our needs, I fear it may well be two months or
more before we can leave these waters.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Surely you can make what repairs are necessary in less
time&mdash;you need not rebuild the ship.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Nay&mdash;but the ship is sprung at every seam; 'tis nothing
but good fortune that has kept it afloat so long.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>The seams sprung?</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye&mdash;all of them.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Then our stores are in danger of being ruined.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, they are even now in such danger they should be unshipped.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Then we must do it&mdash;set your crew to the work at once.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>The crew has more than it can do to repair the ship and
make it ready to sail on to Virginia, since you insist on
going on.<!-- Page 26 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Then I'll set our company to work on the stores&mdash;we
must not let them be ruined.</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Nay, or you'll all face starvation, for you can count on
nothing from the land at this late date.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>I'll gather the company together at once and set them to
work!</p>

<p class="center">JONES</p>

<p>Aye, do, Master Carver.</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>We must unship the stores; [<i>going</i>] we'll begin at once.
[<i>sound of door opening</i>]</p>

<p class="center">JONES [<i>to himself</i>]</p>

<p>Mayhap your company will have something to say to that,
Master Carver.</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So Carver gathered together his company in the common
cabin, and standing before the stern-faced, storm-weary
gathering, the Elder spoke:</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Men of the Pilgrim company, as no doubt you are all well
aware by now, the land we made this morning with such
joy and thanksgiving in our hearts is not the land of the
Virginia Plantation.</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Aye, we know as much!
So we have heard. [<i>etc.</i>]<!-- Page 27 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>But our ship is sore distressed from the buffeting of the
storms, and Captain Jones must needs make repairs before
we can sail on to our destination. [<i>protests and grumblings</i>]</p>

<p>I would it were not so, for I know how weary you find
yourselves after the many days upon the sea. But there's
naught else to do.</p>

<p class="center">PETER [<i>calling</i>]</p>

<p>Why can't we land here? [<i>mob assents</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Nay, nay, it cannot be. This is not Virginia; we have no
patent to these lands. We must sail on. The captain and
his crew will make their repairs as soon as they can, but
our stores in the hold are all of them in danger of spoiling&mdash;so
we must needs unship them ourselves until such time
as we may sail away from here. So let every man prepare
himself for work.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Master Carver&mdash;we are not able to work. [<i>mob assents</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>And more&mdash;'tis not our wish to stay aboard this ship
longer&mdash;[<i>mob assents</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>But we can do naught else&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Aye, we kin land here, and find a goodly place to build our
homes and prepare against the winter that will be down
upon us long before we kin get to Virginia. [<i>mob agrees
heartily</i>]<!-- Page 28 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Men&mdash;men&mdash;quiet&mdash;hark to me! We've no right
under our charter to settle here!</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>Then tear up the charter. [<i>mob agrees</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>Tear up the charter? Have no government? Nay, we
can't do that!</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>We be freemen, Master Carver; we have a right to a voice
in what we'll do, and what we won't do&mdash;and we all want
to land here, don't we, men? [<i>all agree</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>But if we make our home here, we are outside the King's
rule.</p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>We'll rule ourselves&mdash;we be free-born Englishmen! [<i>all

<p class="center">CARVER</p>

<p>It may be for the best interest of the company and for the
glory of Jehovah. I consent to your wishes. [<i>cheers</i>]
But it behooves us to enter into a compact, one with the
other&mdash;that no man may say, once we have landed in New
England, that we have no law and cannot punish the disobedient.<!-- Page 29 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">PETER</p>

<p>And so in the cabin of the <i>Mayflower</i> the masters of the

organized the first self-governing community

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
